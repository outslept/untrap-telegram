### User Filtering

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not available now. API is subject to change. I tryna test this locally, before pushing.

If user filtering is enabled:

- Click this button to hide messages from that user
- To see messages from a blocked user again, click the unblock button (âœ“)
- To clear the entire blocked users list, use the &quot;Clear blocked users list&quot; command in the script menu

### Stickers

If sticker hiding is enabled:

- Click on the placeholder to see the sticker
